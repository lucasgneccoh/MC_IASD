# MC_IASD
Final project - IASD - Monte Carlo

We implement the game Onitama and test different algorithms to play the game

## Todo
- Check the hashtables
- Implement the play function using the hashtables
- Compute the variables MaxLegalMoves, MaxTotalLegalMoves
- Try UCT, RAVE, GRAVE, SequentialHalving, SHUSS ---- HERE
- Adapt and run the tournament.py
- Finish the GUI by adding the visual of the cards, maybe an animation of the moves
